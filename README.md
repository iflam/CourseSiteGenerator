# CourseSiteGenerator
This Course Site Generator's purpose is to be able to create a simple course website through a clean, comfortable UI. 
The Course Site Generator consists of 5 tabs, dealing with various aspects of the website.

Course Details

In this tab you set details that will appear on the headers of pages and what pages you want. 

"Export Directory" refers to the location specified by you in which the exported html files will go.

"Template Directory" refers to the location of your HTML files. Note, the program only works 
using these 5 HTML files (located at the default location), however you can change the 
contents of the html files and put them wherever you want.

"Banners" are the clickable pictures located on the top and bottom of the screen.
"Css styling" lets you pick your own custom-made css styling, if you so wish.

TA Data

In this tab you can add TA's to your class.
Type in a TA name, click "add."
In order to add them to the schedule, click their name in the table, followed by any and all times of their office hours in the table.

Recitation Data
